Blackjack, but in the terminal. For some reason? 

## Build Process
Everything is easily touched by the Makefile. Just:
`make`

From there, the binary is located in the `/bin` folder, and should be ready to go!

## Notes
The UI elements are cobbled together with hopes and dreams, if you use a terminal
that has anything non-standard about it, I can almost guarantee it will break and look
atrocious.
